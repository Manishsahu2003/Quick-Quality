“A Smart device to detect Urea present in milk”.
PROBLEM STATEMENT:-
When the excess amount of urea and other harmuful chemical impurities are present in the milk ,there will be increase in the amount of nitrogen in the milk .
The excess amount of nitrogen will cause many health diseases like cancer,kidney failures and heart attacks which are the major impacts.
According to the research, FSSAI has declared that the 65% of the milk we drink is adulterated.
EXISTING SOLUTION:-
For the solution of this problem,there are many existing solutions such as the PAPER BASED SOLUTION which will detect the ph of the milk but the problem with this solution is that it cost around 250 INR for one time use which is not affordable for daily uses.
Other solutions are ISMART PROMPT ANALYZER cost around 39,000 INR and INDIFOSS MILKOSESS cost aprox 2,50,000 INR which are  not affordable and also difficult to use.
OBJECTIVE:-
After knowing the disadvantage of existing solution,our objective is to make a device which is portable ,easy to use ,cheap and time efficient.
PROPOSED SOLUTION:-
We are making an detection device which is able to detect the amount of urea present in the milk, ph , temperature and TDS of milk with the high accuracy of data and real time monioring of data.
our device is portable,easy to use,budget friendly, time efficient(can detect urea in just 2 sec) and can be use multiple times.
WORKING:-
We are using pH sensor,temperature sensor,TDS sensor,ESP32 and OLED for displaying data and a buzzer for signals.All the result will show on the website/application and we are storing our entire data on the cloud with the help of firebase.
